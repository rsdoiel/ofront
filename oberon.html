<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>oberon - the Oberon operating environment</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>oberon [-f fontmapfile] [-u displayunit] [-d display] [-g geometry] [-c]</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>oberon starts the Oberon operating environment, which may be used as an integrated Ofront development system. Oberon requires an X-Windows server, a three button mouse and a postscript printing device. The Oberon process may be terminated by executing (i.e., by clicking with the middle mouse button on) the command System.Quit (after removing the leading !) within the Oberon environment or by sending a QUIT signal (3) to the Oberon process. Oberon supports the DISPLAY environment variable and the -display and -geometry options as usual for X clients. For speeding up character display, Oberon fonts can be converted to X11 fonts. The Oberon tool InstallXFonts.Tool gives further information about this conversion, however, it is not a Unix or X-Windows tutorial. If you are not familiar with Unix or X-Windows, ask your system administrator to help in installing the fonts.</p>
<p>Special keys used by Oberon and their meanings are:</p>
<p>key meaning</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>F1 set * marker</p>
<p>F2 alias to Escape</p>
<p>F3 Break character</p>
<p>F4 init colors</p>
<p>F6..F10 (+Shift, +Ctrl, +Ctrl-Shift)</p>
<p>characters beyond 127.</p>
<p>Ctrl-a, o, u, A, O, U, s german Umlaute and double s</p>
<p>Ctrl-L redraw all viewers</p>
<p>* On older SUN OpenWindows configurations remove the line xmodmap -e 'keysym F1 = Help' from your .xinitrc file in order to make F1 available to Oberon. An alternative that avoids changing the .xinitrc file is to use the command xmodmap -e 'keycode 12 = F1' to use the F1 key.</p>
<p>Keyboard interrupts may be generated by sending the Oberon process a SIGINT signal either by typing Ctrl-C on the controlling terminal or, if there is no controling terminal, by sending the signal using the kill -2 command.</p>
<h1 id="options">OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>-f fontmapfile</dt>
<dd><p>defines that font names should be mapped according to fontmapfile. If option -f is not specified, no font mapping is performed. The main purpose of this option is to map fonts to bigger ones on displays with very small or unsharp pixels such as color monitors or for video projection. The files Big.Map and Medium.Map are provided as examples for enlarging fonts. See option -u for the effect of using Big.Map or Medium.Map on the display unit size. If font mapping is performed, the result of printing documents will not be exact. Therefore, if you want to get high quality printing results, don't use this option.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-u displayunit</dt>
<dd><p>defines the size of a display unit (pixel) in world coordinates, where one millimeter equals 36000. The default display unit is 10000, which is adequate for displays with about 90 dots per inch. If option -f Big.Map ist used, the default changes to 8000, for Medium.Map to 9000. displayunit must be a positive integer number smaller than 32768.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-d display</dt>
<dd><p>specifies the display server as usual for X clients.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-g geometry</dt>
<dd><p>specifies the window geometry as usual for X clients.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-c</dt>
<dd><p>requests as many colors as possible from the window manager. If not specified, Oberon requests 16 colors.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="environment">ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<dl>
<dt>OBERON</dt>
<dd><p>a colon-separated list of directories in which Oberon searches for files. If OBERON is not defined, files are only searched in the current working directory. Note that shell specific characters like &quot;~&quot; are not supported by Oberon. The environment variable OBERON may be set e.g. under the C-shell by</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>% setenv OBERON .:Mylib:OberonLib</p>
<dl>
<dt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH, etc.</dt>
<dd><p>a colon-separated list of directories in which the dynamic linker searches for shared object libraries. The lookup strategies between different Unix versions differ slightly. The name of the environment variable to be used for library lookup is also platform specific. SunOS and Linux use LD_LIBRARY_PATH, AIX uses LIBPATH, and HP-UX uses SHLIB_PATH.</p>
</dd>
<dt>OberonStartup</dt>
<dd><p>This optional module is loaded upon startup of oberon in order to allow for automating user specific settings. It requires dynamic module loading being available, which is for example the case under Linux. The distribution does not contain binaries for this module but provides a template module in source form.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="files">FILES</h1>
<dl>
<dt>temporary files</dt>
<dd><p>Oberon allocates temporary files prefixed with '.tmp.' and removes them when terminated with System.Quit. If the Oberon process is abnormally terminated (e.g. by a kill signal (9)), the .tmp.* files may survive and should be explicitly deleted by the user. Do not delete .tmp.* files while Oberon is using them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Oberon.Printfile.ps</dt>
<dd><p>Oberon allocates a file 'Oberon.Printfile.ps' when printing documents. If the name of the printer is &quot;none&quot;, this file will not be sent to the printer and contains the generated postscript output; otherwise it will be sent and deleted afterwards.</p>
</dd>

<h1 id="documentation">DOCUMENTATION</h1>
<p>Oberon contains basic online documentation to enable first-time users to get started. In particular it contains the Oberon text files OberonGuide.Text, OfrontUser.Text and the Edit.Guide.Text. For serious work we recommend the following books published by Addison-Wesley and Springer Verlag.</p>

<p>An Oberon-FAQ (frequently asked questions) list is available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu /pub/usenet/news.answers/Oberon-FAQ.</p>
<p>The Internet newsgroup comp.lang.oberon is also sometimes a valuable source of information and the preferred forum for Oberon related discussions. A mail gateway to this newsgroup exists via a mailing list called oberon-news@inf.ethz.ch managed by listproc@inf.ethz.ch. Send a mail with the keyword 'help' in the body</p>
