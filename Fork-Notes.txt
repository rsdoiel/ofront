Fork Notes
----------

This is a fork of jtempl's ofront repository in GitHub.
I'm trying to improve my oberon by playing with existing
Oberon code so I better understand the dialects and changes
on the way with Wirth's Oberon-7. If you're looking for the
real Ofront go to https://github.com/jtempl/ofront or look
at the website https://www.software-templ.com under 
"shareware".  Ofront is licensed with an Open Source
license. RSD, 2021-05-01
